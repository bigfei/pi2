## Note: Avaya Vantage Basic Application (as well to any other Android Avaya Breeze Client SDK based application) running
## on Avaya Vantage Devices retrieves this configuration file after testable parameters 
## (such as $GROUP, $MODEL4, $MODEL4, $IPADD, $MACADDR and $SUBNET) were analyzed 
## by Avaya Vantage Devices. Therefore, any configuration assigned to specific GROUP, etc will be provided to the 
## Avaya Vantage Devices belong to this GROUP, etc and to the Android Avaya Breeze client SDK based application running on them.
##
## Note: Avaya Vantage Basic Application (as well to any other Android Avaya Breeze Client SDK based application) can use
## any configuration parameter defined in this file or even use their own NEW parameters configured
## in such file. It is the application responsibility to extract these parameters from the configuration
## file that Avaya Vantage Devices generates for the application. Only Android Avaya Breeze Client SDK Based application
## can access the configuration file generated by the Avaya Vantage Device according to 
## ACTIVE_CSDK_BASED_PHONE_APP configuration parameter. The configuration file generated by the Avaya Vantage devices for 
## the Android Avaya Breeze Client SDK based application includes analyzed version of this file, then configuration received 
## from Avaya Aura Device Services(if enabled) and then specific configurations parameters received from other sources such 
## as DHCP/LLDP/PPM/UI.
##
## Note for Avaya Vantage device and Avaya Vantage Basic Application (as well to any other Android Avaya Breeze Client SDK based application):
## Any parameter configured using this file can also be configured in Avaya Aura Device Services. AADS has higher precedence compare to this file
## download from HTTP/S file server.
## 
## Avaya Vantage Open application retrieves all its configuration from the Avaya MPS server. All Avaya Vantage configuration parameters are 
## applicable when Avaya Vantage Open application is used unless explicitly stated otherwise below. 
## Avaya Vantage open is NOT based on Avaya Breeze Client SDK.

## VLANSEP specifies whether VLAN separation will be enabled by the built-in Ethernet switch
##  while the telephone is tagging frames with a non-zero VLAN ID. When VLAN separation is enabled,
##  only frames with a VLAN ID that is the same as the VLAN ID being used by the telephone
##  (as well as priority-tagged and untagged frames) will be forwarded to the telephone.
##  Also, if the value of PHY2VLAN (see below) is non-zero, only frames with a VLAN ID that is
##  the same as the value of PHY2VLAN (as well as priority-tagged and untagged frames) will be
##  forwarded to the secondary (PHY2) Ethernet interface, and tagged frames received on the
##  secondary Ethernet interface will have their VLAN ID changed to the value of PHY2VLAN and
##  their priority value changed to the value of PHY2PRIO (see below).
##  Value  Operation

##	    1. Priority-tagged and untagged frames from the network port will be forwarded to the PC port only when VLANSEP==1,
##	       H1xx sends tagged packets (L2Q==0 or 1 and VLANTEST==0 or timer < VLANTEST) and L2QVLAN<>0, else to both phone and PC ports.
##	    2. No enforcement of PHY2VLAN and PHY2PRIO on tagged VLAN packets received from PC port. If VLANSEP==1,
##	       H1xx sends tagged packets (L2Q==0 or 1 and VLANTEST==0 or timer < VLANTEST) and 0<>PHY2VLAN<>L2QVLAN<>0 then:
##		a. Untagged packets from PC port will be tagged with PHY2VLAN and priority==0. 
##              b. Tagged packets will be forwarded as tagged packets only if their VLAN equal to PHY2VLAN. 
##	       Otherwise the packets from PC will be sent unmodified.
##	    Only in case of VLANSEP==1,H1xx sends tagged packets (L2Q==0 or 1 and VLANTEST==0 or timer < VLANTEST) and 0<>PHY2VLAN<>L2QVLAN<>0, 
##	    there will be full separation between PC and phone traffic. In all other cases, PC traffic can reach the phone.
## SET VLANSEP 0
##
## VLANSEPMODE specifies whether full VLAN separation will be enabled by the built-in Ethernet switch
##  while the telephone is tagging frames with a non-zero VLAN ID. This VLAN separation is enabled when:
##  VLANSEP=1, L2QVLAN<> PHY2VLAN (and both has value different than 0), L2Q is auto (0) or (1)  tagging. 
##  In this new VLAN separation scheme:
##  - Untagged packets from PC port will be forwarded to network port only as untagged packets.
##  - Tagged packets from PC port will be forwarded to network port only as tagged packets only in case 
##    their VLAN is equal to PHY2VLAN. 
##    In this mode, tagged and untagged packets from  PC port will never reach phone’s port. 
##  - Untagged packets from the network will be sent to the PC port only.
##  - Tagged packets from the network port will be sent to the PC port if their VLAN is equal to PHY2VLAN 
##    and to the phone if their VLAN is equal to L2QVLAN. 
##  - 802.1x/LLDP and Spanning tree packets are supported as in previous releases in this new mode.
##  When VLANSEPMODE is 0, then the VLAN separation is based on previous releases where untagged packets 
##  from PC port can reach the phone. 
##  Please note that PHY2PRIO is NOT supported when VLANSEPMODE is 1.
##  Value  Operation
##    0    Disabled 
##    1    Enabled 
##  This parameter is supported by:

##       J129  SIP  R1.0.0.0 and later; Default is 1. VLANSEP is not supported by J129. The conditions for VLAN separation mode are
##		as described above (except no support for VLANSEP). If one the conditions is not fulfilled then J129 
##              will get any tagged/untagged unknown/broadcast/multicast/known DA equal to CPU MAC address packets from the network or PC port.
## SET VLANSEPMODE 1
##
## PHY2VLAN specifies the VLAN ID to be used by frames forwarded to and from the secondary
##  (PHY2) Ethernet interface when VLAN separation (see VLANSEP above) is enabled.
##  Valid values are 0 through 4094; the default value is 0.

################  CAPTIVE PORTAL SETTINGS  ##############
##
## CAPTIVE_PORTAL_SERVER specifies the URL of the captive portal server. 
## Android supports a detection mechanism of whether the device is behind captive portal which requires HTTP authentication 
## in order to access the Internet. The mechanism is based on sending HTTP requests to http://clients3.google.com/generate_204. 
## If HTTP response 204 is returned with null content then the device assumes that it is correctly connected to the Internet, 
## else captive portal is assumed. There may be customers who block access to the Internet (or to certain Internet pages) 
## and for these customers the detection mechanism will notice that the device is not connected to the Internet and raise notification. 
## For these customers, the CAPTIVE_PORTAL_SERVER parameter shall be configured to “” (default). “” (null string) implies that the detection mechanism is disabled. 
## There may be other customers that want to have their own captive portal server. These customers can configure their own HTTP server. 
## As long their HTTP server does NOT return 204 with null content then the device will assume it behind captive portal 
## and redirect the user to the relevant HTTP authentication page. As the default of CAPTIVE_PORTAL_SERVER is null, 
## then customers may need to do staging of the device and set CAPTIVE_PORTAL_SERVER to the relevant captive portal server 
## in the settings file before deploying the device in the field (mainly for cases where captive portal prevent download of 
## configuration files in the field) OR configure CAPTIVE_PORTAL_SERVER in the local DHCP server deployed in the field.

## Note: The SSH server on the endpoints is used by Avaya Services only for debugging purposes only. 
## The SSH server supports only Avaya Services Logins ("craft" and "sroot").
## By enabling Avaya Services Logins you are granting Avaya access to your endpoints.
## This is necessary required to maximize the performance and value of your Avaya
## support entitlements, allowing Avaya to resolve product issues in a timely manner.
## In addition to enabling the Avaya Logins, the Avaya Product that the endpoints register with must be registered 
## using the Avaya Global Registration Tool (GRT, see https://grt.avaya.com) to be eligible for Avaya remote connectivity. 
## Please see the Avaya support site (support.avaya.com/registration) for additional information for registering products 
## and establishing remote access and alarming.
## By disabling Avaya Services Logins you are preventing Avaya access to
## your endpoints. This is not recommended, as it can impacts Avaya’s ability to provide
## support for the product. Unless the customer is well versed in managing the product
## themselves, Avaya Services Logins should not be disabled.
## The access to the SSH server is protected by ASG (Legacy authentication algorithm)

##  that string will be replaced by the telephone's serial number, and
##  if the value contains the string "$MACADDR" (without the double quotes),
##  that string will be replaced by the telephone's MAC address.
##  Valid values are strings of ASCII characters; the default value is null ("").

## SET NVVPNUSER AvayaPhone$SERIALNO
##
## NVVPNPSWDTYPE
## Valid Values
##    1  Save in Flash.
##    2  Erase on reset.
##    3  Numeric One Time Password.
##    4  Alpha-Numeric One Time Password.
##    5  Erase on VPN Termination
## Description
##    This variables determines how password should be treated. By default 
##    password type is set to 1. You must set this variable to 3 or 4 if
##    using One Time Password such as SecureID from RSA. 
## Note 
##    Setting password type to 3 will not let the user select "Alpahbets" 
##    while entering password. This might look like an obvious choice when
##    using RSA secure ID tokens. However under some conditions user may 
##    need to respond back by entering 'y' or 'n' in the password field.
##    This could happen if RSA ACE server is configured to generate PIN 
##    instead of letting the user select a PIN.
## Example : Setting password type to 2 (Erase on reset)
## SET NVVPNPSWDTYPE 1
##
## NVVPNCOPYTOS
## Valid Values
##    1  YES
##    2  NO
## Description 
##    Value of this variable decides whether TOS bits should be copied from
##    inner header to outer header or not. If it's value is 1, TOS bits are
##    copied otherwise not. By default TOS bits are not copied from inner
##    header to outer header. Some Internet Service Provider don't route the
##    IP packets properly if TOS bits are set to anything other than 0.
## Example
##    SET NVVPNCOPYTOS 1
## Note
##    It is highly recommended that this value should not be changed if phone
##    is downloading the script over the VPN tunnel in order to avoid 
##    overriding end user setting due to ISP specific issues. For example you
##    can set this value to 1 while provisioning phone with VPN firmware so 
##    that phone can take advantage of QOS service provided by home router but
##    if the phone's ISP (Few percent cases) does not handle properly the 
##    packets with non-zero TOS bits in IP header, phone user will have to
##    revert back this value to 2. Under such circumstances it is desirable
##    the user's choice don't get overriden every time script is downloaded.
## Example: Setting NVVPNCOPYTOS to 1 if script is not downloaded over VPN tunnel.
##    IF $VPNACTIVE SEQ 1 GOTO skipcopytos
##    SET NVVPNCOPYTOS 1
##    # skipcopytos
## SET NVVPNCOPYTOS 2
##
## NVVPNENCAPS
## Valid Values
##    0  4500-4500
##    1  Disable
##    2  2070-500
##    4  RFC (As per RFC 3947 and 3948)
## Description
##    Type of UDP encapsulation method to use if there is a NAT device between
##    phone and the security gateway. By default UDP Encapsulation 4500-4500
##    is used. 
##    If NVVPNENCAPS is 0, ike negotiation starts with source port of 2070
##       and destination port 500. Negotiation switches to port source port
##       4500 and destination port 4500 if peer supports port floating (Ref 
##       RFC 3947,3948). Finally IPsec traffic is send inside UDP packets 
##       from/to port 4500 if supported by peer or port 2070<->500 if port
##       floating is not supported but UDP encapsulation is supported as 
##       published in the initial draft versions of RFC 3947 and 3948.
##     If NVVPNENCAPS is 1, ike nat traversal is completly disabled.
##     If NVVPNENCAPS is 2, Port floating is disabled during IKE nat traversal.
##     If NVVPNENCAPS is 4, ike negotiation starts with source port of 500 and
##       destination port 500. Negotiation switches to port source port 4500
##       and destination port 4500 if peer supports port floating (Ref RFC 3947
##       and 3948). Finally IPsec traffic is send inside UDP packets from/to 
##       port 4500 if supported by peer or port 500<->500 if port floating is 
##       not supported but UDP encapsulation is supported as published in the
##       initial draft versions of RFC 3947 and 3948.
## Note
##    UDP Encapsulation causes overhead hence it might be desirable to disable
##    udp encapsulation if NAT device supports IPsec pass through and there is
##    only one IPsec client behind the NAT connecting to the same security 
##    gateway. However not all devices support IPsec pass through hence this
##    value must not be pushed if phone is downloading the script over the VPN tunnel.
## Example : Setting NVVPNENCAPS to 1 if script is not downloaded over VPN tunnel.
##
##          IF $VPNACTIVE SEQ 1 goto skipencaps
##          SET NVVPNENCAPS 1
##          # skipencaps
##
## The example above will set NVVPNENCAPS to 1 if script is not downloaded over the tunnel.
## SET NVVPNENCAPS 0
##
## NVIKEPSK
## Valid Values
##    String. Length of the string cannot exceed 30 characters.
## Description
##    Preshared Key to use during phase 1 negotiation.
## Note 
##    It is recommened that user enter his/her Preshared Key using phone's 
##    dialpad. However if you don't want to share PSK with the end user 
##    because it's common for multiple users you can use this variable to 
##    push PSK (Group password) to each phone and the end user will never
##    know what the PSK is. But if you are doing this, make sure that the file 
##    server is on an isolated network and is used only for provisioning
##    VPN parameters to the phones.
## Example : Setting abc1234 as Preshared Key
## SET NVIKEPSK abc1234
##
## NVIKEID
## Valid Values 
##     String. Length of the string cannot exceed 30 characters.
## Description
##     Phone uses this string as IKE Identifier during phase 1 negotiation. 
##     Some XAuth documentation refer to this variable as group name because 
##     same IKE Id is shared among a group of user and indvidual user 
##     authentication is done using XAuth after establishing IKE phase 1 
##     security association.
##  The default value is "VPNPHONE".

##    11   KEY-ID (Opaque)
## Description
##    Phone uses this variable as the IKE Identifier type for the 
##    IKE-ID specified via NVIKEID variable.
## Note
##    This variable default value depends on the value of variable NVVPNCFGPROF.
## SET NVIKEIDTYPE 2
##
## NVIPSECSUBNET
## Valid Values
##     Comma separated list of strings containing subnet and masks. Number of
##     strings cannot exceed 5.
## Description
##     This variable contains IP subnets protected by the security gateway.
##     By default phone assumes that all the network resources are behind 
##     the security gateway hence it negotiates for a security association
##     between it's IP address (or Virtual IP if delevired via IKE Config 
##     mode) and 0.0.0.0 with the security gateway. If your security gateway
##     is configured to allow building security association for only selected
##     subnets, you can specify them here.
## Example : 
##     Configuring 10.1.12.0/24 and 172.16.0.0/16 as the subnets protected by
##     the Security Gateway
##     SET NVIPSECSUBNET 10.1.12.0/24,172.16.0.0/16

##     In dual IPv4/IPv6 mode, during SIP ANAT negotiation, 
##     MEDIA_NEG_PREFERENCE is used to prioritize media lines in SDP. 
##     By default offerer's preference is used. 
##
##     MEDIA_NEG_PREFERENCE of zero means when there is a choice between IPv4 and IPv6 address,
